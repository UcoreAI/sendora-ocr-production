## Quick Fix Deployment

Run these commands on your Elestio server to fix the session validation error:

### 1. Connect to your server
Use the Elestio terminal or SSH:
```bash
ssh root@5.223.52.132
```

### 2. Navigate to project and pull latest fix
```bash
cd /opt/app
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Rebuild and restart the application
```bash
# Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild with the session fix
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start with fixed code
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Verify the fix worked
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# Check logs for any errors
docker-compose logs --tail=20 sendora-ocr

# Test health endpoint
curl -f http://localhost:5000/health
```

### 5. Test the complete workflow

2. Upload a test invoice/PDF
3. Click "Process Document" - this should now work!
4. Validate the extracted data
